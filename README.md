# 🚀 LLM Simplified: Making Large Language Models Easy to Understand

Welcome to **LLM Simplified**, an initiative to **break down complex concepts from Large Language Models (LLMs) into easy-to-understand explanations**.

This project is inspired by the book **Building LLMs for Production** by *Louis-François Bouchard* and *Louie Peters*, as well as the amazing work done by [Towards AI](https://towardsai.net/). My goal is to **make LLMs accessible to everyone**—whether you're an AI expert or just getting started.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

LLMs are **powerful**, but their concepts can be difficult to grasp. This repository is designed to:

✅ **Explain LLM concepts in layman’s terms**  
✅ **Use visuals, icons, and graphics to enhance understanding**  
✅ **Break down topics into easy-to-follow chapters**  
✅ **Provide real-world examples, analogies, and simple explanations**  
✅ **Help developers, business professionals, and AI enthusiasts understand LLMs without deep technical expertise**  

## 📖 How to Use This Repository?

- The content is structured into **separate pages** covering different topics.
- The **README file** links all sections together for easy access.

👉 **Start learning by exploring the topics below!**
